    Notes:

    Display: Grid
    for display: grid I made a small grid with no rows but onyl columns to use for my header, with the main title in column 1 and the subtitle in column 6

    Display: Flex
    for display: flex, I created a class for my images and applied flex to that, using flex-wrap and space-between to space them out evenly and create two rows of four images each. 

    Positon: fixed
    for my fixed positoning, I created a header for the class and positoned it in the center to scroll with the page.

    Position: relative
    for relative positoning, I applied it to the text within my display: flex class to reduce the space between my images and captions.
