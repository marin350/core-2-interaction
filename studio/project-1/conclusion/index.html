    When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut 
    the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody 
    feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence 
    or reading it after it has been written. And what does a comma do, a comma does 
    nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without 
    the comma. A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you 
    know yourself knowing it and the comma, well at the most a comma is a poor period 
    that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to 
    know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether 
    has something to do with going on, but taking a breath well you are always taking 
    a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. Anyway that is 
    the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I 
    almost never used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater 
    the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more 
    the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care 
    of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by 
    putting in a comma.

    So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little 
    different but more so and later I will go into that. But that is the way I felt 
    about punctuation in prose.
