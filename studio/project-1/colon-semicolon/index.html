    There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons 
    you can think of them as commas and as such they are purely servile or 
    you can think of them as periods and then using them can make you feel 
    adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I 
    myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and 
    commas are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent 
    upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical 
    purposes. Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely 
    this character the character that a comma has and not the character 
    that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used them. 
    But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly 
    they might have in them something of the character of the period and so 
    it might have been an adventure to use them. I really do not think so. 
    I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely
    more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them. 

    They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they 
    are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply within them 
    fundamentally within them the comma nature. And now what does a comma do 
    and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them. When I was 
    writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active 
    present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. 
    I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and 
    conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.
    Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked 
    dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of 
    their variety of dependence and independence. You can see how loving the 
    intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading. 
    Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of 
    excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about 
    that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. 
    Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do.

    Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I mean.
