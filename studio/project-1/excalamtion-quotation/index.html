    Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they are 
    unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing 
    and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a question is a question 
    what is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true of a quotation. 
    When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks 
    and quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. 
    Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody 
    can and does see it that way. 
    
    So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way 
    that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. 
    There are besides dashes and dots, and these might be interesting spaces might 
    be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them.
