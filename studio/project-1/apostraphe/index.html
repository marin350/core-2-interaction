    One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about 
    and that is the apostrophe for possession. Well feel as you like 
    about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the 
    possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes 
    it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. One does do
    without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from 
    time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put 
    it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like it and 
    leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not 
    ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it does 
    appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time 
    to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and 
    sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from 
    time to time let it come in. So now to come to the real question of 
    punctuation, periods, commas, colons, semi-colons and capitals and small 
    letters. I have had a long and complicated life with all these. Let us 
    begin with these I use the least first and these are colons and semi-colons, 
    one might add to these commas.
